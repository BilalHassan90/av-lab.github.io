## AV Perception and Situation Awareness
This research direction is centered on enhancing perception and situation awareness within the realm of autonomous vehicles. Future efforts will prioritize the establishment of robust perception mechanisms that can competently interpret environmental uncertainties. Current projects span from detecting and tracking multiple objects, predicting vehicle wheel slip in off-road conditions, to semantic segmentation of underexposed images.
